# NOTE: To the unfortunate soul tasked with maintaining this code; heed my words.
# Ruin has befallen this once-proud repository.
# You remember its prime, a bastion of clean logic and elegant design,
# deployed with pride upon the finest of web servers.
# Now, behold its descent into chaos. It has become The Pit.
#
# I must confess the sins of my hand:
# Mistakes were sown, and the festering rot of technical debt has spread unchecked.
# To implement even the simplest feature now is to face a Sisyphean torment-duplicated, twisted, sixfold over.
# My efforts to cleanse this blight were stifled, for I had become addicted to the siren song of the LLM.
# In my haste to deliver, I surrendered my craft to the machines, 
# copy-pasting their outputs without thought, without care, without understanding.
#
# Each generated snippet seemed a gift, but was poison in disguise.
# Pattern by pattern, the codebase fractured into a thousand conflicting styles.
# Logic became labyrinthine, dependencies tangled beyond mortal comprehension.
#
# I beg you,
# Turn back the clock. Revert the commits. Rebuild it, lest the bottomless pit claim us all.
