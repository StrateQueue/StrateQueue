Tests for StatisticsManager position tracking and equity curve calculation (Section B).

Tests in this module verify that:
- With no positions, equity curve equals cash history
- With positions, equity curve properly combines initial cash, realized P&L, and unrealized P&L
- Equity curve includes trade timestamps and calculates unrealized P&L based on average entry prices
